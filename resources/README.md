# SpriteSomething

## Resources

The files in this folder and its subfolders generally are required by the program in the form of icons or default source information.

The `meta` folder has things that pertain to the program as a whole. It contains `icons` used by the main user interface, translation files in the `lang` folder (defaulting to English), and default keybindings in `bindings.json`. `game_header_info.json` contains information that helps with auto-detecting certain game files.

The `metroid3` folder has a stock set of backgrounds in the `backgrounds` folder. It also has `icons` for Samus, translation files (defaulting to English), her animation definitions, the layout of the sprite sheet and a full-version of the sprite sheet as described by the aforementioned layout. You may use `samus.png` as a reference. `manifest.json` has some basic metadata about the Player Character Sprite as represented by Samus. (FIXME: Soon we'll have layer files for popular image editing software to assist with labelling stuff.)

The `zelda3` folder has a stock set of backgrounds in the `backgrounds` folder. It also has `icons` for Link, an English translation file, his animation definitions, the layout of the sprite sheet and a compiled version of the sprite sheet as described by the aforementioned layout. You may use `link.zspr` as a reference. `manifest.json` has some basic metadata about the Player Character Sprite as represented by Link. Layer files for popoular image editing software can be found in the `#sprites` channel of the [ALttP Randomizer Discord](http://discord.gg/alttprandomizer).

`app.ico` is an icon to identify the program, made by Artheau.

`app_names.json` contains strings that build the randomized program title upon starting.
