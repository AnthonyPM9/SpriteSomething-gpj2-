#common functions for all entities (i.e. "Sprites")
#sprites are responsible for maintaining their widgets
#they have to contain PIL images of all of their data, and the offset info, and how to assemble it
#and they have to interpret the global frame timer, and communicate back when to next check in

#this file needs to contain all the metadata for the sprites
